<p>Members of Team 1 have completed research of 10 deployment software along with choosing the top 3</br>
software to test. Some software did not fit the requirements while others had fit almost all requirements</br>
except one or two, which the pros far out weigh the cons. Ghost Solution Suite, Endpoint Central, and Clonezilla</br>
are the top 3 that were chosen to be tested in the next Milestone where the team will be evaluating how each software</br>
will fare with each other.
